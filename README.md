# India-s-Disabled-Population-A-Statistical-Look-at-Household-Distribution-2011-Census-
Project utilizes data from the 2011 Indian Census to analyze the distribution of people with disabilities across different types of households (normal, institutional, houseless) and locations (rural, urban) throughout the country.

Normal Households: The majority of disabled individuals reside in normal households across both rural and urban areas. However, there are variations across states, with Maharashtra having the highest number in both urban and rural areas.

Location: There seems to be a higher prevalence of disabled individuals in rural areas compared to urban areas for normal and institutional households. This might be due to factors like access to healthcare or under-reporting in urban areas.

Institutional Households: Maharashtra has the highest number of people with disabilities residing in institutional households in both rural and urban areas. The data suggests a significant presence of institutional facilities in the state.

Houseless Households: Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of homeless households with disabilities in both rural and urban areas. This highlights the need for support systems for this vulnerable population.

Variations Across States: Population size, urbanization rates, and access to healthcare facilities might influence the distribution of disabled individuals across different household types and locations.
